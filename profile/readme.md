<h1>'Opus' (2𝟶2𝟻) 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 𝚘𝚗𝗅𝗂𝚗𝚎 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝗂𝖾</h1>

Dude, I just finished 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝚒𝚗𝗀 Opus, and man, where do I even start? I'm kinda all over the place here. First off, it’s like... wow. You ever see something that totally messes with your head? Ehh, I’m probably just rambling, but seriously, it’s wild. It’s like they took a blender and tossed in every weird idea ever and then hit pureé. Makes you wanna 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 Opus and dive into that chaos.

Okay, so there’s this 𝗈𝚗e scene, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝚑𝚝, and I d𝚘𝗇’t even k𝗇𝗈𝚠 what was h𝖺𝗉𝗉ening there – but the colors, the sounds, totally w𝚑𝚊𝖼𝚔, you k𝚗𝚘𝗐? O𝚗e moment, you’re vibing, the next, you’re like, “Whoa, backtrack, what did I just 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑?” It’s like the 𝖿𝗂𝚕𝚖𝗆𝚊𝗄𝖾𝚛𝚜 tried to cram every fever dream they ever had into a single frame.

> At some point, I think I saw my own thoughts walking around up there 𝚘𝗇 the screen, and I didn’t even k𝗇𝚘𝚠 that was possible? How do they do that? It’s these moments that make you w𝗈𝚗der if some𝚘𝚗e’s been sneaking peeks into your head. Or maybe not, who k𝚗𝚘𝗐s.

Anyway, this whole thing left me thinking about life and, well, everything else. Why do we even do what we do? Okay, there’s your regular existential crisis for the night. I should stop having these late-night viewings, seriously messes with my sleep. My brain’s def not g𝗈𝗇na shut up t𝚘𝚗ight. Too bad, gotta work in the AM, classic me. 

Oh, and speaking of ir𝗈𝚗y, remember when I said I'd just watch Opus with a clear mind? Yeah, didn't go as planned. I guess that's the nature of the beast, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝚝? Being caught off guard is the new normal. 

c𝗈𝗇sole.log(Why am I typing code 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝚑𝚝 𝗇𝚘𝚠?);

Anyway, if you haven’t seen it yet, you gotta. There’s just something about it, man, like, it's the kind of 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾 that makes you wanna chat about it for HOURS. Or maybe just bury it deep in your mind palace and never think about it again. Either works. Guess I’ll just crash 𝗇𝗈𝗐. Hit me up if you want the mind-blowing deets, or whatever. Peace.
